# GitHub Tutorial — Classroom Materials

This folder contains a small static site and exercises to teach Git & GitHub.

Quick start (teacher)
1. Open `index.html` in a browser to use the slides and simulator.
2. Use `teacher.md` for a lesson plan and `student.md` for a printable student guide.
3. Share the `exercises/starter` folder or create a GitHub Classroom assignment for students.

No server required — the site is static.
