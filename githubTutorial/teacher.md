# Teacher Guide — Git & GitHub Classroom

This folder contains a lightweight slide-like website and materials to teach Git & GitHub to middle/high school students.

How to use in class
- Open `githubTutorial/index.html` in a browser (no server required) and use the Slides mode to present topics.
- Switch to Simulator mode during the live demo to demonstrate commits, branches and merges.
- Ask students to open the Student mode and follow the exercise links.

Lesson plan (45–60 minutes)
1. (5m) Warm up: What is version control? Why track changes?
2. (10m) Slides: Basic concepts and workflow.
3. (10m) Live demo: Use the simulator to create commits, branches, and merge.
4. (20m) Student exercise: Pair students, complete exercises in `exercises/` and create a Pull Request.
5. (remaining) Wrap up and reflect.

Assessment
- Check student commits and PRs for meaningful messages and correct branching.

Notes
- No install required for the simulator. For real git practice, provide a GitHub Classroom or starter repo.
