# Student Guide â€” Git & GitHub Exercises

Welcome! This guide will help you practice Git with a simple exercise.

Steps to follow
1. Open `exercises/` and read `README.md` for instructions.
2. Use the Simulator in `index.html` to try commits and branches.
3. When ready, follow the teacher's instructions to clone the real repo and make a branch.
4. Make small commits with meaningful messages.
5. Push your branch and open a Pull Request.

Tips
- Commit messages should be short and explain the change (e.g., "Add about section").
- Use branches for features (e.g., `feature/about`) and keep `main` stable.

Good luck and ask your teacher if you get stuck!
